When you are developing projects in microservices architecture, it is crucial to following Microservices Observability, Microservices Resilience and Monitoring principles.

So, we will separate our Microservices Cross-Cutting Concerns in 4 main pillars;

Microservices Observability with Distributed Logging using ElastichSearch

Microservices Resilience and Fault Tolerance with Appling Retry and Circuit-Breaker patterns using Polly

Microservices Monitoring with Health Checks using WatchDog

Microservices Tracing with OpenTelemetry using Zipkin

So we are going to follow this 4 main pillars and develop our microservices reference application with using latest implementation and best practices on cloud-native microservices architecture style.

We have already developed this microservices reference application in the microservices course, So with this course, we will extend this microservices reference application with Cross-Cutting Concerns for provide microservices resilience.

We are going to cover;

Cross-Cutting Concerns in 4 main parts;

Microservices Observability with Distributed Logging,

This applying Elastic Stack which includes Elasticsearh + Logstach + Kibana and SeriLog nuget package for .net microservices.

We will docker-compose Kibana image from docker hub and feed Kibana with elastic stack

Microservices Resilience and Fault Tolerance using Polly

This will apply Retry and Circuit-Breaker Design Patterns on microservices communication with creating Polly policies.

Microservices Health Monitoring with using WatchDog

This will be the Aspnet Health Check implementation with custom health check methods which includes database availabilities - for example in basket microservices, we will add sub-health check conditions for connecting Redis and RabbitMQ.

Microservices Distributed Tracing with OpenTelemetry using Zipkin

This will be the implementation of OpenTelemetry with Zipkin.

By the end of this course, you'll learn how to design and developing Microservices Cross-Cutting Concerns - Microservices Observability with Distributed Logging, Health Monitoring, Resilient and Fault Tolerance with using Polly".

Before beginning the course, you should be familiar with C#, ASP.NET Core and Docker. This course will have good theoretical information but also will be 90% of hands-on development activities.
